# AI Learning Platform

Mini AI-driven learning platform that allows users to select learning topics, receive AI-generated lessons, and track their learning history.AI Learning Platform
This is a mini learning platform that allows users to select topics and receive lessons generated by AI. The project includes a REST API backend, a database running in Docker, and an Angular web dashboard.

## Technologies Used

-Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.

-Database: MongoDB (Running via Docker Compose).

-Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

-Frontend: Angular 17, TypeScript,Standalone Components

-AI: OpenAI API (with a fallback mock mode).

## Key Features
User registration and secure authentication using JWT.

Category and sub-category selection.

AI-generated lessons stored in the database.

User learning history.

Admin dashboard to view all users and their prompt history.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular layered architecture. Each module (Users, Categories, Prompts) is separated into clear layers:

Routes: API endpoint definitions.

Controllers: Request and response handling.

Services: Business logic and AI integration.

Repository :  

Models: Database schemas and relationships.

## Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Node.js installed.

Docker Desktop installed and running.

1. Database
Run the following command to start the database: docker-compose up -d

2. Backend
Navigate to the backend folder.

Run npm install.

Create a .env file based on .env.example.

Run the server using: npx tsx main.ts

Note: On the first run, the system automatically seeds the database with categories, sub-categories, and an Admin user (Phone: 0548545618).

3. Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder/ai-platform-fronted .

Run npm install.

Start the application using: ng serve

Open your browser at http://localhost:4200.

## Assumptions
-Admin User: For security and simplicity, the admin user is created via a database seed script.

-Authentication: JWT is used to secure user sessions and admin-only routes.

-Unique Identification: Users are identified by their phone number as a unique key.

-Data Persistence: Docker volumes are used to ensure data is saved even if the container stop
